This is a site to hold resume for myself, along with pages containing more details about portions of my resume. Some of these portions may have links to official sources for certifications or degrees, or they may link to other projects that I have made.

The structure of the webstite is as follows:
index.html
- education.html
- experiance.html

How to update:
Updating the site requires pulling the repository to your local machine and making the modifications there. Once they are done they need to be commmited and pushed back to the github repository, where the wesbite will update.
